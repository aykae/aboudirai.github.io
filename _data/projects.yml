  desc: An LED modifcation for my WowGo electric longboard.
  body: I wired up an accelerometer, an individually addressable LED strip, and a 6V battery pack. Then, I modeled a closed case for this arrangemnt in Blender, 3D printed it, and screwed it to the bottom of my board, where its other electronics lay. The lights are fully programmable, and can react to the motion data captured by the accelerometer.
  tech: Arduino (C/C++), Blender
