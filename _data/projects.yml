  desc: An LED modifcation for my WowGo electric longboard.
  body: I wired up an accelerometer, an individually addressable LED strip, and a 6V battery pack. Then, I modeled a closed case for this arrangemnt in Blender, 3D printed it, and screwed it to the bottom of my board, where its other electronics lay. The lights are fully programmable, and can react to the motion data captured by the accelerometer.

  desc: Spaced Repetition study app to supplement college courses
  body: Released to the App Store under my ed-tech company Tryber Inc., my co-founder and I developed EasyA in order to provide free study tools for students who struggled with maintaining structured study habits. I developed the customer-facing app and internal backend, while my co-founder wrote the course content and exerises. Once the user marked that they had learned a topic in one of our three supported courses (Calculus I, Intro to Biology, Intro to Chemistry), EasyA would notify the user in spaced intervals to review a summary of a topic they had learned, as well as take a short quiz to test their comprehension.

- name: UnlockMe
  desc: Device that unlocks MasterLock w/ Digital Keypad
  body: Back during my sophomore year of high school, I attended the Univesity of Pennsylvania's hackathon, PennAppsXV, and worked on a device that swiftly opened a rotary Masterlock based on digital keypad input. I 3D printed a piece that latched onto both the shaft of a stepper motor and the dial of the Masterlock. With an Arduino, I was able to translate digital keyboard input of the lock's combination and convert that into corresponding rotations that opened the lock with great speed. In typical hackathon fashion, the enclosure for the device was intricately constructed out of cardboard and electrical tape.
