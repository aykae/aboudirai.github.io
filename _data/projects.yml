- name: MoCap Animation Blending
  desc: A smooth blending of three animations captured on a Vicon MoCap System
  body: Using the University of Pennsylvania SIG Lab's Vicon Motion Capture System, I recorded three separate MoCap scenes. Using the captured data and Autodesk MotionBuilder, I applied the data onto a rigged character model, and then blended the transition between the three scenes so that the result is a realistically continuous animation.

- name: FK/IK System
  date: "OCT 2022"
  desc: Forward and inverse kinematics system for character animation
  body: Given an input of keyframed joint angles for various animations, I implemented the Forward Kinematics and their interpolation for a rigged character model. Two Inverse Kinematics techniques were also implemented, Limb-Based IK and Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD) IK to allow joint angle computation given a target position of a joint. This project was assigned in my Computer Animation course (CIS5620). Source code is privated due to course integrity restrictions. Feel free to email hi@aykae.com for access.

- name: Starbox
  desc: Dynamic Decorative Lighting for Stargazers
  body: My first polished commercial product, Starbox is a dynamic light display that continuously generates random star clusters of different sizes, colors, and brightness. Rare shooting stars are also generated and displayed. Device enclosure was modeled in Fusion 360. Star generation and HUB75 light display written in Python. Available now at my Etsy shop linked below!

- name: WowGlow
  desc: An LED modification for my WowGo electric longboard.
  body: I wired up an accelerometer, an individually addressable LED strip, and a 6V battery pack. Then, I modeled a closed case for this arrangement in Blender, 3D printed it, and screwed it to the bottom of my board, where its other electronics lay. The lights are fully programmable, and can react to the motion data captured by the accelerometer.

- name: "EasyA: Study Smart"
  date: "AUG 2020"
  desc: Spaced Repetition study app to supplement college courses
  body: Released to the App Store under my ed-tech company Tryber Inc., my co-founder and I developed EasyA in order to provide free study tools for students who struggled with maintaining structured study habits. I developed the customer-facing app and internal backend, while my co-founder wrote the course content and exercises. Once the user marked that they had learned a topic in one of our three supported courses (Calculus I, Intro to Biology, Intro to Chemistry), EasyA would notify the user in spaced intervals to review a summary of a topic they had learned, as well as take a short quiz to test their comprehension.

- name: Augmented Reality Instagram Filter
  date: "JAN 2020"
  desc: Filter for random Penn State college selection
  body: Implementing the node-based programming of SparkAR, combined with the various Penn State College frames I designed in Photoshop, I was able to create a roulette type animation that concluded with a randomly selected college for the filter user. The first filter published to Onward State's Instagram, it garnered roughly 100,000 impressions via 50,000 videos created.

- name: UnlockMe
  desc: Device that unlocks MasterLock w/ Digital Keypad
  body: Back during my sophomore year of high school, I attended the University of Pennsylvania's hackathon, PennAppsXV, and worked on a device that swiftly opened a rotary Masterlock based on digital keypad input. I 3D printed a piece that latched onto both the shaft of a stepper motor and the dial of the Masterlock. With an Arduino, I was able to translate digital keyboard input of the lock's combination and convert that into corresponding rotations that opened the lock with great speed. In typical hackathon fashion, the enclosure for the device was intricately constructed out of cardboard and electrical tape.

  date: "NOV 2019"
  desc: Onward State's first interactive app
  body: Intended to show the collective staff prediction of Penn State's College Football Playoff chances based on the variable outcome of their next three games, this Javascript app was the first of its kind to be published on the Penn State blog, Onward State. Developed using JavaScript Canvas and Adobe Photoshop, this app allowed Penn Staters to simulate all possible outcomes of their football team for the tailend of the 2019 season.
