  desc: An LED modifcation for my WowGo electric longboard.
  body: I wired up an accelerometer, an individually addressable LED strip, and a 6V battery pack. Then, I modeled a closed case for this arrangemnt in Blender, 3D printed it, and screwed it to the bottom of my board, where its other electronics lay. The lights are fully programmable, and can react to the motion data captured by the accelerometer.

- name: "EasyA: Study Smart"
  date: "AUG 2020 &rarr; PRESENT"
  desc: Spaced Repetition study app to supplement college courses
  body: Released to the App Store under my company ed-tech Tryber Inc., my co-founder and I developed EasyA in order to provide free study tools for students who struggled with maintaining structured study habits. I developed the customer-facing app and internal backend, while my co-founder wrote the course content and exerises. Once the user marked that they had learned a topic in one of our three supported courses (Calculus I, Intro to Biology, Intro to Chemistry), EasyA would notify the user in spaced intervals to review a summary of a topic they had learned, as well as take a short quiz to test their comprehension.
  tech: Swift (iOS app), Django (backend), AWS (hosting & storage)
