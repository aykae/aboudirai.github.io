I started labeling cardboard boxes about five months back. My strain of box-labeling (BL) bears no resemblance to the pragmatic BL one might take part in while moving homes, for instance, or when one stores old trinckets and heirlooms in their attic. *No*, that kind of BL is about tidiness, organization, efficiency &mdash; cardinal sins for a iconoclastic artist, such as myself. My BL produces boxes that hold deeper meaning, audaciously blurring the lines between bleeding-edge technology, household d&eacute;cor, and contemporary art. Before I elaborate on the artistic process it takes to create one of my boxes, I'd like to take a moment to recount my sources of inspiration.

There are three men in particular whom I can confidently attribute my BL work to: Jeff Bezos, Casey Neistat, Virgil Abloh.

## The Notorious JB
Ultimately, I would not have access to such an abundance of cardboard if not for the work and liveliehood Jeffrey P. Bezos and the hardworking men and women over at **Amazon.com, Inc.**. Sometimes I'll use the Amazon boxes that are used to deliver me my package, and other times I might just let loose, bend the rules just a smidge, and use the box that my product comes manufactured in. 

Whenever I leave my apartment through the back exit (the side closer to my University campus), I'm often horrified at the amount of cardboard boxes in our communal recyclying bins&mdash;boxes that carry the decorational weight of any tapestry, movie poster, or WiFi-compatible LED light strip. It takes immense restraint to not take a few of the boxes back up to my apartment&mdash;takes even greater effort to hold back the tears.

I have never recycled a cardboard box. I'm not really into burning money, anyway.

## Big Creator in the Big Apple
Casey Neistat

## Purveyor of the gray area between black and white
Virgil Abloh [(ILWIIR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inna_Lillahi_wa_inna_ilayhi_raji%27un), the founder and CEO of *Off-White* as well as artistic director of Louis Vuitton's menswear collection, has had a plainly obvious influence on my BL style, predominantly inspiring the actual content of the text that is fastidiously transcribed onto the Casey's label, that is then adhered to Jeff Bezos' boxes. 

I make use of the renowned *Off-White* quotation marks. If you don't know what I'm referencing, one look at these 10 items will surely be sufficient in demonstrating the oneness of *Off-White*. I know what you're thikning, that solid black coin pouch with no design but the text, "POUCH", on it probably should not be retailing at $360. However, it is the fact that heaps of narrow-minded, fashion-averse consumers share this opinion that makes the product so valuable.

I have borrowed the quotation mark approach of design, and have applied it to my BL. Parallel to *Off-White*'s use of descriptive labeling, the words contained within the quotation marks for my BL simply denote what the box does&mdash;it's innate and perpetual purpose, if you will.

Although my works of BL are not currently up for sale, when the day comes that I deem the people of this world categorically ready for my art, I will commercialize with rapacious haste.
