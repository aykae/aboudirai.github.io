I started labeling cardboard boxes about five months back. My strain of box-labeling (BL) bears no
resemblance to the pragmatic BL one might take part in while moving homes, for instance, or even the
kind one uses to store old trinckets and heirlooms in their attic. *No*, that kind of BL is about
tidiness, organization, efficiency &mdash; cardinal sins for a iconoclastic artist, such as myself.
My BL produces boxes that hold deeper meaning, audaciously blurring the lines between bleeding-edge
technology, household d&eacute;cor, and contemporary art. Before I elaborate on the artistic process
it takes to create one of my boxes, I'd like to take a moment to recount my sources of inspiration.

There are three men in particular to whom I can confidently attribute my BL work: Jeff Bezos, Casey
Neistat, Virgil Abloh.

## The Notorious J.P.B.
Ultimately, I would not have access to such an abundance of cardboard if not for the work and
liveliehood Jeffrey P. Bezos and the hardworking men and women over at **Amazon.com, Inc.**.
Sometimes I'll use the Amazon boxes that are used to deliver me my package, and other times I might
just let loose, bend the rules just a smidge, and use the box that my product comes manufactured in. 

Whenever I leave my apartment through the back exit (the side closer to my University campus), I'm
often horrified at the amount of cardboard boxes in our communal recyclying bins&mdash;boxes that
carry the decorational weight of any tapestry, movie poster, or WiFi-compatible LED light strip. It
takes immense restraint to not take a few of the boxes back up to my apartment&mdash;takes even
greater effort to hold back the tears.

I have never recycled a cardboard box. I'm not really into burning money.

## Big Creator in the Big Apple
I wouldn't say that I am a die-hard fan of Casey Neistat's. Still, I've watched a small, curated
selection of his videos, and learn a lot from them by studying his daily routine and habits, his
attiudes on life and career, and most notably, his heterodox style as a creative. One example of the
latter that always stood out to me was his method of personalizing his Ray-Ban sunglasses.

As is quite clear, these are no typical Ray-Ban's to which one might see the average conventionalist
conform (i.e., buying a pair and wearing them out of the box, protecting them from any scratches or
damage). Casey diverges from the status quo from the get-go, vandalizing the luxury glasses directly
after purchasing, not even granting them a premortem traditional wear. On a pair of all-black
Ray-Ban's, he'll start by using an angle grinder to remove the Ray-Ban logo that appears on one of
the temples, and a pairing knife to remove the logo that appears on the right lens. The cherry on
top is a generous coating of white spray paint, which is then scraped of with a popsicle stick to
ensure visibiltiy. After all, they stil need to be utile, but without any brand association with
Ray-Ban. Here's his [video](https://youtu.be/zyLfkbhw95U) on how and why he does this&mdash;the video
that initially caught my attention years back.

How does this relate to my case of BL? Well, I'll tell you. Right now. Casey has given various tours
of his studio where he builds things, records things, and ultimately creates things, and so I've
began to pick up his habit of liberally labeling things. 

Some examples from Casey's [studio tour](https://youtu.be/vb60rrtTddQ):

I'll often find myself feeling doubtful and uncertain with my BL, in regards to the thought of
messing up something that is already precious by labeling it, or not having visually-appealing
enough handwriting to consitute a label as a medium of decoration. This video changes my mind
whenever I watch it, as I can admire Casey's originality and execution of creative quirks that he
thinks are useful, with little mind paid to the thoughts and perceptions of others: a paradoxical
approach that results in millions admiring what he does, for the very originality into which he puts
no effort. 

I consequently decided to start labeling my apartment, not just because that's what Casey did, but
also because I personally liked the look of it. And the crucial part, I knew I could personalize
it&mdash;make it my own.

## Purveyor of the gray area between black and white
Virgil Abloh [(ILWIIR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inna_Lillahi_wa_inna_ilayhi_raji%27un), the
founder and CEO of *Off-White* as well as artistic director of Louis Vuitton's menswear collection,
has had a plainly obvious influence on my BL style, predominantly inspiring the content of
the text that is pedantically transcribed onto the Casey's label, that is then adhered to Jeff Bezos' boxes. 

My BL makes use of the renowned *Off-White* quotation marks, and if you don't know what I'm referencing,
here's an example of one of the brand's luxury accessories:

I know what you're thinking, that solid black coin pouch with no design but the text, "POUCH", on it
should probably not be retailing at $360. However, the very fact that heaps of narrow-minded,
fashion-averse consumers share this opinion is precisely what makes this product so valuable.

I have borrowed the quotation mark approach of design, and have applied it to my BL. Parallel to
*Off-White*'s use of descriptive labeling, the words contained within the quotation marks for my BL
simply denote what the box does&mdash;it's innate and perpetual purpose, if you will.

Although my works of BL are not currently up for sale, when the day comes that I deem the people of
this world categorically ready for my art, I will commercialize with rapacious haste.
