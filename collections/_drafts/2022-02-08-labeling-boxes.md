I started labeling cardboard boxes about five months back. My strain of box-labeling (BL) bears no resemblance to the pragmatic BL one might take part in while moving, for instance, or when storing old trinckets and heirlooms in your attic. *No*, that kind of BL is about storage, organization, efficiency &mdash; cardinal sins for a iconoclastic artist, such as myself. My BL produces boxes that hold deeper meaning, audaciously blurring the lines between hand-crafted sculpture, household d&eacute;cor, and __________. Before I elaborate on the artistic process it takes to create these pieces, I'd like to take a moment to cite my sources of inspiration.

There are three men in particular, WHOM I can confidently attribute my BL to: Jeff Bezos, Virgil Abloh, Casey Neistat.
