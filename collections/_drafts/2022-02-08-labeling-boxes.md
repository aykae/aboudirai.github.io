I started labeling cardboard boxes about five months back. My strain of box-labeling (BL) bears no
resemblance to the pragmatic BL one might take part in while moving homes, for instance, or even the
kind one uses to store old trinkets and heirlooms in their attic. *No*, that kind of BL is about
tidiness, organization, efficiency &mdash; cardinal sins for a iconoclastic artist, such as myself.
My BL produces boxes that hold deeper meaning, audaciously blurring the lines between bleeding-edge
technology, household d&eacute;cor, and contemporary art. Before I elaborate on the artistic process
it takes to create one of my boxes, I'd like to take a moment to recount my sources of inspiration.

There are three men in particular to whom I can confidently attribute my BL work: Jeff Bezos, Casey
Neistat, Virgil Abloh.

## The Notorious J.P.B.
Ultimately, I would not have access to such an abundance of cardboard if not for the work and
livelihood Jeffrey P. Bezos and the hardworking men and women over at **Amazon.com, Inc.**.
Sometimes I'll use the Amazon boxes that are used to deliver me my package, and other times I might
just let loose, bend the rules just a smidge, and use the box that my product comes manufactured in. 

Whenever I leave my apartment through the back exit (the side closer to my University campus), I'm
often horrified at the amount of cardboard boxes in our communal recyclying bins&mdash;boxes that
carry the decorational weight of any tapestry, movie poster, or WiFi-compatible LED light strip. It
takes immense restraint to not take a few of the boxes back up to my apartment&mdash;takes even
greater effort to hold back the tears.

I have never recycled a cardboard box. I'm not really into burning money.

## Big Creator in the Big Apple
I wouldn't say that I am a die-hard fan of Casey Neistat's. Still, I've watched a small, curated
selection of his videos, and learn a lot from them by studying his daily routine and habits, his
attitudes on life and career, and most notably, his heterodox style as a creative. One example of
the latter that always stood out to me was his method of personalizing his Ray-Ban sunglasses.

As is quite clear, these are no typical Ray-Ban's to which one might see the average conventionalist
conform (i.e., buying a pair and wearing them out of the box, protecting them from any scratches or
damage). Casey diverges from the status quo from the get-go, vandalizing the luxury glasses directly
after purchasing, not even granting them a pre-mortem traditional wear. On a pair of all-black
Ray-Ban's, he'll start by using an angle grinder to remove the Ray-Ban logo that appears on one of
the temples, and a pairing knife to remove the logo that appears on the right lens. The cherry on
top is a generous coating of white spray paint, which is then scraped of with a popsicle stick to
ensure visibility. After all, they still need to be utile, but without any brand association with
Ray-Ban. Here's his [video](https://youtu.be/zyLfkbhw95U) on how and why he does this&mdash;the
video that initially caught my attention years back.

How does this relate to my case of BL? Well, I'll tell you. Right now. Casey has given various tours
of his studio where he builds things, records things, and ultimately creates things, and so I've
began to pick up his habit of liberally labeling things. 

Some examples from Casey's [studio tour](https://youtu.be/vb60rrtTddQ):

I'll often find myself feeling doubtful and uncertain with my BL, in regards to the worry of
messing up something that is already precious by labeling it, or not having visually-appealing
enough handwriting to constitute a label as a medium of decoration. This video changes my mind
whenever I watch it, as I can admire Casey's originality and execution of creative quirks that he
thinks are useful, with little mind paid to the thoughts and perceptions of others: a paradoxical
approach that results in millions admiring what he does, for the very originality into which he puts
no effort. 

I consequently decided to start labeling my apartment, not just because that's what Casey did, but
also because I personally liked the look of it. And the crucial part, I knew I could personalize
it&mdash;make it my own.

## Purveyor of the gray area between black and white
Virgil Abloh [(ILWIIR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inna_Lillahi_wa_inna_ilayhi_raji%27un), the
founder and CEO of *Off-White* as well as artistic director of Louis Vuitton's menswear collection,
has had a plainly obvious influence on my BL style, predominantly inspiring the content of
the text that is pedantically transcribed onto the Casey's label, that is then adhered to Jeff Bezos' boxes. 

My BL makes use of the renowned *Off-White* quotation marks, and if you don't know what I'm referencing,
here's an example of one of the brand's luxury accessories: 

{: .center}
<img src="/assets/img/labeling-boxes/offwhite-pouch-front.jpg" width="65%" height="auto" />

I know what you're thinking, that solid black coin pouch with no design except the text, "POUCH", on it
should probably not be retailing at $360. However, the very fact that heaps of narrow-minded,
fashion-averse consumers share this opinion is precisely what makes this product so valuable.

I have borrowed the quotation mark approach of design, and have applied it to my BL. Parallel to
*Off-White*'s use of descriptive labeling, the words contained within the quotation marks for my BL
simply denote what the box does&mdash;it's innate and perpetual purpose, if you will.

Although my works of BL are not currently up for sale, when the day comes that I deem the people of
this world categorically ready for my art, I will commercialize with rapacious haste.

## My BL Process
My box labeling process is quite simple, and only takes a couple of minutes. If you follow these
directions closely, you'll likely end up with a labeled box that looks quite similar to mine, but of
course, not *exactly* like mine. You might lead yourself to believe that BL is a trivial artform,
and that you've gotten the hang of it after a few boxes. To that, I can but humbly respond that my
labeling is more intricate than images can convey, and that I've been fine-tuning my craft for
months (5, to recount); you, a nascent student of said craft, have a long way to go before reaching
a level of experience to begin comparing your work with mine, and even then, there is a level
*natural talent* that just cannot be taught. Notwithstanding, this is not reason to be discouraged.
Just follow the instructions scrupulously, and you surely will end up with a product that is, put
lightly, not abysmal. Let us commence.

### Step 1: Find a Box
Veteran BLers, like myself, source our boxes from Amazon.com, not only for their top-tier quality
corrugated cardboard, but also for their prestigious name brand logo repeated across the tape job.

### Step 2: Apply the Label
For my labeling, I exclusively use 3M Highland Masking Tape, with dimensions 0.96'' by 60 yards and
a 3'' core. Stay away from Scotch&trade;&mdash;some will claim that their product is superior, but
the brand recognizability allows for viewers of your art to make blasphemous claims including, "Did
you just put Scotch&trade; tape on an Amazon box and write on it?". Knowing damn well that we did
NOT use Scotch&trade; tape on an Amazon box, we can respond stating so. Voil√†, the air of mystery is
preserved. The marker selection isn't as important, a black Sharpie chisel-tip permanent marker will
suffice. The contents of the label, shall be explained in the next step.

### Step 3: Find a Use Case
It is crucial that the label of the box must align with it's use case, which must be selected
carefully. Boxes are a versatile device, malleable to a handful of use cases: propping up other
objects, storing valuable contents within, or, if you are feeling bold, the use case of pure
decoration&mdash;mere d&eacute;cor. Once you find the use case, write it in all caps, append the
word "BOX", and wrap the whole thing in quotations. This is my own stylistic device inspired by
Off-White that that you may feel free to borrow. The following examples of my BL work should
adequately represent the results of following these steps that I have enumerated.
