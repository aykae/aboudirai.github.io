### Overview

### Prohibited Elements of Conventional Insurance
<br>

**1. Policy Contract Uncertainty**
    
Upon paying premiums to a conventional insurance carrier those funds enter a blackbox, in which the allocation, investment, and repayment of those funds are obscured from the policyholder (or in the latter case, often not applicable). The circumstances under which claims are covered are uncertain and inconsistent, there is no transparency as to what the policyholderâ€™s funds are being invested in, and the policyholder is completely removed from the distribution of profits, both in knowledge and, more crucially, *in participation*. 
    
**2. Interest-Bearing Investment of Funds**
    
Unclaimed funds held by the conventional insurance carrier are invested in order to further generate profits for the business, often involving interest-bearing financial instruments such as bonds. These interest-based returns on investment makes its way back to the policyholder when the insurer pays for any claims that are successfully filed, rendering the interacting impermissible in accordance with Sharia law. 
    
**3. Gambling w/ Premiums**
    
A conventional insurance policy involves the policyholder paying premiums with only a chance that they will see that money in the form of filing a claim. An analogy between conventional insurance and blackjack can be made as follows: we can liken premiums to placing continuous bets into the pot, filing a major claim (upon the pure chance of a covered event occurring, e.g., a car accident) to winning the hand and receiving more than what was paid, and not filing a claim to the House winning the pot. And if we may stretch out this analogy for one more crucial point: the House *always* wins.
